Under the bushes in the garden of an old farm, ducklings hatched. They were all small, yellow, and fluffy, except one - bigger and different. Its mother initially mistook it for a chicken, but as she saw how skillfully it swam, she grew fond of it.
However, the other inhabitants of the poultry yard constantly mocked its appearance. More than that - the hens, geese, turkeys, and even its own brothers and sisters pecked, plucked, and pushed it, calling it "ugly." Eventually, the duckling couldn't take it anymore and fled. It ran and ran until it reached a large marsh. It hadn't rested from the long run when thunder and barking came from all sides. The duckling, frightened, hid in the reeds and watched in horror as its relatives - the wild ducks - fell one after another, pierced by bullets.
The poor little thing spent the whole day and night among the reeds. In the morning, a terrible storm broke out. Freezing and hungry, the duckling left the marsh and set off again. Finally, it reached the cottage of a poor old woman who took pity on it and sheltered it warmly. The old woman, nearly blind, mistook it for a duck. She fed it diligently, hoping it would lay eggs for her.
Besides the mistress, there lived a tomcat and a one-legged hen in the cottage. They both thought themselves very clever and beautiful. They constantly teased the little duckling, and one day, it couldn't take it anymore and left the old woman's house. But its troubles were not over yet. As it passed through the village, children chased it with laughter and quacks, cats hissed, and dogs pursued it with barks.
Finally, the poor duckling reached a small lake and swam. Suddenly, several magnificent white swans appeared in the sky. They noticed the duckling and descended towards it. "They will surely kill me because I threaten their lake," thought the miserable creature and humbly lowered its head towards the water. But what did it see in the transparent surface of the lake? It had grown up. And in the reflection of the water, it saw not some gray and ugly bird, but a white and elegant swan.
At that moment, two children ran to the shore.
"Look, a new swan has arrived!" they exclaimed. "It's the most beautiful of all!"
