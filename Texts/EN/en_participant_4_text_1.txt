Once upon a time in a beautiful countryside, there lived a duck who sat on her nest. She watched anxiously as her eggs hatched one by one until she was left with one large egg. She decided to let it incubate longer and soon found that it was not like the others. On a nice day, she took her young brood to swim in the river and they all went in for a swim.
"Oh," the mother duck said, "that is not a turkey. He\'s a little clumsy, but he\'s my own child, and I think he\'s quite cute. Let\'s introduce him to the farmyard." The farmyard was chaotic as two families battled for an eel. The mother duck tried to teach the duckling how to behave, but another duck scoffed at him and one even bit him in the neck. "Let him alone," said the mother. The duckling was miserable due to his size and ugliness. He eventually ran away to a remote moor where he felt more accepted.
The duckling is at first ignored by the wild ducks but is later offered a chance to become a bird of passage. He turns down this offer when he sees that it leads to shooting and killing the birds. The duckling then seeks shelter in a storm-tossed cottage where he is taken in by a woman, her tomcat, and her hen. Though the woman initially takes the duckling as a stray, she later keeps him as a pet, along with the tomcat and hen who regard him as part of their own.
The duckling thinks it's absurd that it can only swim on water, but the hen argues that it's too cold to go underwater. The hen also asks the cat and the old woman if they'd like to swim in the water, implying that the duckling is crazy for wanting to do so. The duckling gets frustrated with the conversation and goes out into the world, where it finds a lake and swims in it. However, all other animals avoid it due to its appearance. As winter approaches, the duckling has to swim on ice to keep from freezing over and eventually becomes exhausted and frozen in the water until a peasant comes to its rescue."
In this passage, a duckling escapes from its home after causing chaos due to fear. It finds itself outside in the snow and eventually makes its way to a garden filled with beautiful spring blooms. When the children see him, they are delighted and call for their father, who throws bread into the pond. The duckling, ashamed of his happiness, hides under his wing.
