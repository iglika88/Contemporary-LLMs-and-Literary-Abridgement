 Under the bushes in the garden of an old farmhouse, ducklings had hatched. They were all small, yellow, and fluffy, except for the last one. It was so large and different from the others that its mother initially mistook it for a chicken. But when she saw how skillfully it swam, she relaxed and grew fond of it.
However, the other inhabitants of the poultry yard constantly made fun of its appearance. Moreover, the chickens, geese, turkeys, and even its own brothers and sisters pecked, plucked, and pushed it and called it "ugly." Eventually, the duckling couldn't bear it anymore and ran away. It ran and reached a large swamp. It had not rested from the long run when thunder and barking filled the air from all sides. The duckling, scared, hid in the reeds and watched in horror as its wild relatives—wild ducks—fell one after another, pierced by bullets.
The poor little one spent the whole day and night among the reeds. In the morning, it started raining, and a terrible storm broke out. Frozen and hungry, the duckling left the swamp and set out on the road again. Finally, it reached the cottage of a poor old woman who took pity on it and sheltered it warmly. The old woman, almost blind, mistook it for a duck. She fed it diligently and hoped that it would lay eggs for her.
Besides the landlady, there lived a tomcat in the cottage, who could purr, arch his back, and even spark when his fur was rubbed, and a one-legged hen. The two thought themselves very clever and beautiful. They constantly made fun of the little duckling, and one day it couldn't take it anymore and left the old woman's house. But its troubles didn't end there. As it passed through the village, the children chased it with laughter and quacks, the cats hissed, and the dogs chased it with barks.
Finally, the lonely duckling reached a small pond and swam in it. Suddenly, several magnificent white swans appeared in the sky. They noticed the duckling and descended toward it. "Surely, they will kill me because I threaten their pond," thought the lonely creature and humbly bowed its head to the water. But what did it see in the transparent surface of the lake? It had already grown. And in the reflection of the water, it was not some gray and ugly bird but a white and graceful swan.
At that moment, two children ran to the shore.
•	Look, a new swan has come! - they shouted. - He's the most beautiful of all!
