In a farmyard, a mother duck sat on a nest of eggs. One by one, the eggs hatched, revealing beautiful ducklings. However, one egg remained unhatched, and when it finally did, the small duckling that emerged was large and ugly. The other ducklings and the mother duck rejected him, and he was bullied and picked on.
Despairing, the ugly duckling ran away and wandered through the forest. He encountered a pair of wild geese who suggested he join them, but he was shot down when hunters arrived. He sought shelter in a cottage with a tomcat and a hen, but they mocked his inability to lay eggs or purr.
As winter approached, the ugly duckling found himself frozen in a pond. A kind farmer rescued him and took him home, but he was chased out by the farmer's children. He retreated to the forest, where he spent the harsh winter alone and hungry.
In the spring, the ugly duckling found himself in a beautiful garden. He saw three majestic swans swimming in a pool, and he longed to join them. To his surprise, the swans welcomed him, recognizing him as one of their own. The ugly duckling realized that he had transformed into a beautiful swan, graceful and admired by all. He embraced his new identity, having come a long way from the rejected and bullied duckling he once was.
