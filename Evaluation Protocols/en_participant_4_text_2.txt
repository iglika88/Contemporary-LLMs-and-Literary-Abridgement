Georgi spent Christmas in Japan and was sad to not have a tree. On Christmas night, while walking in the city, he heard a baby crying from a bush and found an abandoned kitten. Despite its fear, Georgi patiently coaxed it out with milk and captured it. He pleaded with his parents to keep the kitten, naming it Gifty. After Christmas, Georgi returned to school and was surprised to find that his classmates were interested in Gifty. Georgi realized that his loneliness was over and found a friend in a kitten he found under a bush, which his father called a "Christmas tree."
